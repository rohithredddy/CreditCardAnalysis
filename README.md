# creditCardAnalysis
The provided script appears to be a simple credit card analysis tool implemented in Python, utilizing the pandas, time, sqlalchemy, and matplotlib libraries. The project is structured with various functions, each catering to specific aspects of data analysis, visualization, and export. Below is a description of the different components of the project:

Introduction:

The introduction function prints a detailed message introducing the purpose of the analysis. It mentions that the project aims to predict credit card churn by analyzing a dataset obtained from a specific website. The dataset includes information about customers, such as age, salary, marital status, and credit card details.

Made By:

The made_by function provides information about the creator of the analysis, including the name, roll number, school name, and session.

Read CSV File:

The read_csv_file function reads the dataset from a CSV file (BankChurners.csv) into a pandas DataFrame (df) and prints its content.

Data Analysis Menu:

The data_analysis_menu function presents a menu allowing the user to perform various operations on the dataset. Operations include displaying the entire DataFrame, showing columns, displaying top and bottom rows, showing specific columns, adding new records, adding new columns, deleting columns or records, and performing basic data summary.

Graph Menu:

The graph function provides a menu for generating different types of graphs using the matplotlib library. Supported graph types include line graphs, bar graphs, scatter graphs, and pie charts. The user can choose to visualize data based on gender, card category, education level, or income level.

Export Menu:

The export_menu function allows the user to export the DataFrame to different formats. Options include exporting to a CSV file, an Excel file, or a MySQL table.

Main Menu:

The main_menu function serves as the main entry point for the program. It displays a menu with options to read the CSV file, perform data analysis, generate graphs, export data, or exit the program. The user can navigate through these options interactively.

Execution:

The script concludes by calling the main_menu function, initiating the interactive exploration of the credit card analysis tool.
Overall, the project provides a user-friendly interface for loading, analyzing, visualizing, and exporting credit card data. Users can perform various operations on the dataset and gain insights into factors influencing credit card churn. Additionally, they have the option to export the analyzed data for further use.
